# Curriculum Generation with Gemini API - Implementation Summary

## Overview

We've successfully implemented a curriculum generation feature using Google's Gemini API. This feature allows the learning service to generate personalized curriculums based on a user's selected subject and skill level.

## Key Components Implemented

1. **Dependency Management**:
   - Added `google-generativeai` to `requirements.txt` and `pyproject.toml`
   - Installed the package in the virtual environment

2. **Configuration**:
   - Created `app/config.py` to manage environment variables
   - Added `.env.example` with required variables for Gemini API

3. **LLM Integration**:
   - Implemented `app/llm/curriculum_llm.py` with the `generate_curriculum_with_gemini` function
   - Used JSON prompts to ensure structured responses from the API
   - Added proper error handling and fallback mechanisms

4. **Data Models**:
   - Updated `app/models/curriculum_model.py` with new fields and the `CurriculumRequest` model
   - Enhanced the `Module` model with a description field

5. **Service Layer**:
   - Updated `app/services/curriculum_service.py` to use the new LLM-based generation
   - Maintained backward compatibility with mock data as a fallback

6. **API Endpoints**:
   - Created `app/routes/curriculum.py` with a POST endpoint for curriculum generation
   - Updated `app/main.py` to include the new router

7. **Documentation**:
   - Updated `README.md` with information about the new feature
   - Created `llm_usecases.md` with detailed usage instructions
   - Updated `instruction.md` to reflect the new directory structure
   - Created `phases.md` with example API usage

8. **Testing**:
   - Created `tests/test_curriculum.py` with tests for the new functionality
   - Verified that tests pass with both LLM and fallback implementations

9. **Demo**:
   - Created `scripts/demo_curriculum.py` to demonstrate the feature

## How to Use

1. Set your Gemini API key in the environment variables:
   ```
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
   ```

2. Start the service:
   ```bash
   poetry run dev
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   python -m app.main
   ```

3. Make a POST request to `/curriculum/` with a JSON payload:
   ```json
   {
     "subject": "Python Programming",
     "skill_level": "beginner",
     "path": "newbie"
   }
   ```

4. Receive a personalized curriculum in the response with modules, learning objectives, and recommended tutor style.

## Fallback Mechanism

If the Gemini API is not configured or fails to generate a curriculum, the system automatically falls back to using mock data, ensuring that the service remains functional at all times.

## Future Improvements

1. Add caching for generated curriculums to reduce API calls
2. Implement user feedback integration to improve curriculum quality
3. Add more sophisticated prompt engineering for better results
4. Implement rate limiting for API calls
5. Add support for different Gemini models based on user preferences
