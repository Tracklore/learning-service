# Phase 5 Implementation Plan: Progress Tracking & Feedback

## Overview
Phase 5 focuses on implementing progress tracking and feedback mechanisms to enhance the learning experience. This phase will allow the system to store and analyze user progress, enabling adaptive learning based on individual performance.

## Chunk 1: Progress Tracking Foundation

### Tasks:
1. **Create Progress Pydantic Models**
   - `ProgressModel` to store lessons completed, scores, repeated mistakes
   - `UserProgress` to aggregate user's learning data
   - `ProgressUpdateRequest` for API input
   - `ProgressResponse` for API output

2. **Build `/progress` Endpoints**
   - Create GET endpoint to retrieve user's progress
   - Create POST endpoint to update user's progress
   - Create DELETE endpoint to reset user's progress if needed

3. **User Progress Storage**
   - Design data structure to store user's knowledge state
   - Implement temporary in-memory storage (later to be replaced with DB/vector DB)
   - Add aggregation of performance metrics

### Deliverables:
- `/progress` API endpoints working
- Progress tracking and storage capability
- Basic user progress analytics

## Chunk 2: Advanced Progress Tracking

### Tasks:
1. **Create Progress Tracking Module**
   - Setup `progress_tracking.py` module for progress-related LLM interactions
   - Implement LLM client configuration (reuse existing Gemini setup)
   - Add error handling and logging

2. **Progress Analytics System**
   - Create function to analyze user's learning patterns
   - Implement basic analytics for repeated mistakes
   - Add aggregation of user's performance over time

3. **Integration with Existing Systems**
   - Integrate with teaching service to automatically log progress
   - Connect with evaluation service to capture answer results
   - Add hooks to track lesson completion

### Deliverables:
- Basic progress tracking module
- Progress analytics capability
- Integration with existing learning systems

   - Store user feedback on lessons and tutors
   - Process feedback to adjust learning experience
   - Create feedback aggregation for analytics

3. **Feedback Integration**
   - Add feedback options to lesson completion
   - Integrate with curriculum to capture path effectiveness
   - Connect with tutor persona system for style adjustments

### Deliverables:
- Feedback collection system
- Feedback processing and storage
- Integration with learning experience

## Chunk 4: Progress-Based Adaptation

### Tasks:
1. **Progress Analysis Integration**
   - Integrate progress tracking with curriculum generation
   - Create adaptive algorithms based on user's progress
   - Add intelligent lesson recommendations

2. **Adaptive Learning Paths**
   - Implement personalized curriculum adjustments
   - Add remedial content suggestions based on progress
   - Create acceleration options for high performers

3. **Knowledge State Embeddings**
   - Implement embedding of user's knowledge state into vector DB
   - Create similarity matching for targeted content
   - Add progress-based content filtering

### Deliverables:
- Full progress analysis integration

## Chunk 5: Feedback Loop & Dynamic Adjustment

### Tasks:
1. **Build `/feedback` Endpoint**
   - Create endpoint for user feedback submission
   - Add validation for feedback quality
   - Implement feedback processing pipeline

2. **Dynamic Curriculum Adjustment**
   - Regenerate curriculum based on feedback
   - Adjust pacing dynamically based on progress
   - Implement tutor style change requests

3. **Real-time Adaptation**
   - Create real-time feedback processing
   - Add immediate curriculum adjustments
   - Implement performance-triggered interventions

### Deliverables:

## Chunk 6: Testing and Refinement

### Tasks:
1. **Unit Testing**
   - Test progress tracking endpoints
   - Test feedback collection and processing
   - Test progress analytics functions
   - Mock LLM calls for consistent testing

2. **Integration Testing**
   - Test end-to-end progress tracking flow
   - Test feedback to curriculum adjustment pipeline
   - Test progress-based adaptive learning

3. **User Experience Refinement**
   - Gather feedback on progress tracking interface
   - Refine progress analytics based on effectiveness
   - Optimize feedback collection process

### Deliverables:
- Comprehensive test coverage

## Implementation Priority:

1. **Chunk 1** - Foundation for progress tracking system (High priority for data collection)
2. **Chunk 2** - Core progress tracking functionality (Essential for Phase 5 completion)
3. **Chunk 3** - Feedback collection system (Critical for user input)
4. **Chunk 4** - Advanced adaptation based on progress (Differentiates the product)
5. **Chunk 5** - Dynamic feedback loop (Enables responsive learning)
6. **Chunk 6** - Quality assurance (Ensures reliability)
7. **Chunk 7** - Documentation (Enables adoption and future development)

Each chunk should take approximately 2-4 days to implement, depending on complexity and testing requirements.
